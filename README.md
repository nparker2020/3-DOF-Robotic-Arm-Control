# 3-DOF-Robotic-Arm-Control
Forward, Inverse, and Velocity Kinematics for a 3 DOF Serial Arm Robot (Matlab)


This code was written by 3 Students including myself at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, as part of a higher-level undergraduate course (RBE 3001).

The matlab code was written to control this Robot:
